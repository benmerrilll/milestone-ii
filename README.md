# Predicting California County Changes
Welcome to our predicting county population changes project! This project was completed by Elizabeth Giancola, Kim Di Camillo, and Ben Merrill as a part of their Master of Applied Data Science program.

For extensive documentation, see the Final Project pdf. This is where you will find the project presentation, purpose, and visualizations.

In this repo, we have things like clustering algorithms:

[![California County Clusters](https://github.com/benmerrilll/predicting_county_population_changes_california/blob/main/images/kmeans.png)]

and Principal Component Analysis:

[![PC Biplot](https://github.com/benmerrilll/predicting_county_population_changes_california/blob/main/images/pca_biplot.png)]

Note:
- See join.ipynb file for data aggregation and cleaning_scripts for details on specifics of file cleaning
- See the supervised folder for our modeling approaches to predicting inflow and outflow of California populations by county
- See the unsupervised folder for clusters found inherently in the data, principal component analysis, and more
- All other documentation is in final project pdf
